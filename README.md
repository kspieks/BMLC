# BMLC: Baseline Machine Learning for Cheminformatics
The goal of this repo is to easily train several baseline ML models from sklearn using various fingerprint representations from RDKit. Optuna is used to vary the hyperparameters and optimize performance of each fingerprint + model combination on the provided validation set.
